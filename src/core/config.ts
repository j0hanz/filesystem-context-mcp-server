// Resolved CLI-flag overrides — the one owner of the flag-beats-env rule.
//
// `parseArgs` (cli.ts) used to write flag values back into `process.env` so
// deep core readers (path, sensitive, observability, util) would pick them up.
// That made the environment a hidden mutable config bus. Instead, cli.ts
// assigns onto `cli` once at startup and each reader consults it first, falling
// back to the operator's environment. This module deliberately has zero imports
// so any core module can read it without a cycle.

/**
 * How an operator gives this server a root. Lives here rather than beside its
 * readers because both ends of the repo need it — `index.ts` prints it at
 * startup, `list_roots` returns it when it has nothing to list — and this
 * module is the one place either can import without a cycle.
