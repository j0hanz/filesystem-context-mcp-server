## [2.1.5] - 2026-09-06

An internal-only release: the over-engineering audit, 39 verified cuts across
45 files, net 299 lines removed. No tool, CLI flag, environment variable, or
wire payload changes behaviour.

### Removed

- **The error `details` channel.** `Problem.details` and the `FsError.details`
  getter carried `errno` and `syscall` that nothing read and no response ever
  rendered, and `FsError`'s constructor loses its `details` parameter. The
  client-visible error shape — `code`, `message`, `path`, `suggestion`,
  `issues` — is unchanged.
- **Dead internal surface.** `PathGuard.isServerContext`, `getRootBoundaries`,
  and the `fromAllowedDirectories` test factory; `fs.ts`'s `hash`,
  `createReadStream`, and `StatPath`; `parseEnvDirList` and the
  `pairFailureSchema` factory. Watcher-registry, resources, transport,
  prompts, and CLI exports are trimmed to their real consumers.
- **Unreachable configuration.** Progress total, batch concurrency, `stat` MIME
  knobs, `hasErrorShape`'s `code` parameter, and `fmt`'s stream parameter. None
  was reachable from a tool argument or an environment variable.

### Changed

- `edit` and `replace_in_files` call diff v9 synchronously — the library is
  sync, so the `await` bought nothing.
- Cursor first-page and replay handling folds into `paginate`; `search_text`
  drops its sort indirection and compiles the pattern once per request.

## [2.1.4] - 2026-09-06

A fix release for silent truncation in the text the two search tools return.
No tool, CLI flag, or environment variable changes behaviour and the structured
payload is untouched — only the text block gains trailing `//` lines.

### Fixed

- **`search_text` and `find_files` now say when a page hides results.** The
  position in the set, the next-page cursor, and the engine's stop state lived
  only in the structured half, which the SDK ships under `_meta` for a tool
  that authors its own text — and no client renders that, so a capped page read
  exactly like a complete answer. Both tools now append
  `// showing 5-8 of 9 matches. Next page: search_text {"cursor":"..."}`, on
  every page of a split set including the last one, which has no cursor. A scan
  the engine cut gets a second line,
  `// scan stopped early: hit the server's 10000-result scan cap`, which names
  the cap rather than echoing `maxResults` — that is also the caller's
  page-size argument. The stop line is independent of the cursor, so a
  truncation with too few results to page still says so.
- **`read`'s continuation echoes the path the caller wrote.** It carried the
  resolved absolute path instead, which on Windows is a backslash-doubling JSON
  string that also spells out the server root. Its hint now names the line to
  resume from (`More lines remain from 501.`) rather than the generic
  `File was truncated.`

## [2.1.3] - 2026-09-06

A release that lands the three seams from the 2026-09-05 architecture audit.
One tool behaviour changes — how `list`, `find_files`, and `search_text`
decide when to store their full result — and one environment variable is
deprecated. The wire format, CLI flags, and every other tool are untouched.

### Changed

- **`list`, `find_files`, and `search_text` externalize on one rule.** An
  incomplete first page — more pages follow, or the engine's hard cap cut the
  set — now carries `resourceUri` to the full result in the resource store, for
  all three tools. Before, `list` stored one only on hard-cap overflow,
  `find_files` on any incompleteness, and `search_text` whenever a page held
  more than `FS_MAX_INLINE_MATCHES` matches. Continuation pages never carry it
  and never mint a new one; `search_text` used to store a fresh copy on every
  continuation page that crossed the inline cap.
- **`search_text` shows a whole page inline.** `maxResults` is the page size and
  the inline count; the separate 50-match inline slice is gone. `truncated` now
  means only that the engine cut the match list (hard result cap or timeout) —
  a set that spans several pages has `nextCursor` and is not "truncated".

### Deprecated

- **`FS_MAX_INLINE_MATCHES`** is read only to log a startup warning; it has no
  effect. Use `maxResults` to set the `search_text` page size. The variable is
  removed in the next major release.

## [2.1.2] - 2026-09-05

A fix release for two transport-boundary defects. No tool, no CLI flag, and no
environment variable changes behaviour, and the wire format is untouched — an
MCP client needs to do nothing.

### Fixed

- **`FS_MAX_REQUEST_BYTES` now applies to every POST, not just JSON ones.** The
  Express body parser leaves `req.body` undefined for anything but
  `application/json`, and handing that undefined body to the Node adapter made
  it read the raw stream with no limit — so a `text/plain` upload, or one with
  no `Content-Type` at all, was buffered unbounded before being rejected. Such
  a POST is now answered `415` before its body is read, and a request with no
  body framing gets a JSON-RPC ParseError instead of being forwarded. The `415`
  envelope matches the one the SDK would have produced.
- **A stdio server no longer outlives its connection.** When the SDK closed the
  transport on a fatal read error — a `ReadBuffer` overflow, for one — nothing
  released the watchers the connection had acquired, and the process stayed
  alive after the client was gone. Teardown now also runs on the transport's
  own close, not only on an explicit `close()`, and it unrefs stdin: the SDK
  pauses stdin only when no other `'data'` listener remains, which otherwise
  holds the event loop open with nothing left to serve. A server instance whose
  construction finishes after teardown is disposed rather than published.

## [2.1.1] - 2026-09-05

A cleanup release. No tool, no CLI flag, and no environment variable changes
behaviour, and the wire format is untouched — an MCP client needs to do nothing.

**One `./transport` export narrows.** `RuntimeConfig` no longer accepts
`eventBus` or `deploymentMode`. This is shipped as a patch rather than a major
because neither field was reachable: `index.ts` builds its `RuntimeConfig` from
`httpHost` and `apiKey` alone, so no CLI invocation could ever set them, and
only a caller importing `startHttpServer` from `@j0hanz/filesystem-mcp/transport`
and passing one explicitly is affected. If that is you, drop both fields —
single-instance behaviour is identical.

### Removed

- **Fleet deployment mode.** `RuntimeConfig.eventBus` and
  `RuntimeConfig.deploymentMode`, the two boot guards that enforced them, and
  `assertFleetRequestStateKey`. The feature fanned change events across
  load-balanced instances, but two instances of a filesystem server either serve
  the same disk, where the fan-out buys nothing, or different disks, where the
  shared state is wrong. `FS_REQUEST_STATE_KEY` stays: it keeps in-flight
  `input_required` rounds alive across a restart, which has nothing to do with
  deployment topology.
- **The `qa` npm script** and the `scripts/qa*` harness behind it. It drove the
  MCP Inspector against `dist/` and rendered an HTML report, duplicating
  `__tests__/inspector-*.test.ts`, and no CI job ever ran it.
- **The `ProgressSink` interface.** `McpProgressSink` was its only
  implementation, so `ProgressSession` now holds that type directly instead of an
  array behind an abstraction. Progress notifications on the wire are unchanged.

### Changed

- The `get-help` prompt no longer rejects a `topic` for blankness or shell
  metacharacters. The handler resolves a topic by `Object.hasOwn` against a
  frozen record, so an unrecognized one already falls through to the not-found
  reply and nothing downstream interprets the string. A non-empty check remains.
- A CLI startup error for an unreadable allowed directory now carries Node's own
  message instead of a string rebuilt from `errno`, and attaches the original
  error as `cause`:

  ```text
  Cannot access directory /no/such/dir: ENOENT: no such file or directory, stat '/no/such/dir'
  ```

## [2.1.0] - 2026-09-05

A minor release, not a major one: the package's own API is untouched. Its
`./transport` exports and every CLI flag and environment variable are byte-for-
byte what 2.0.0 shipped. What changed is how tool results look on the wire, and
an MCP client reading them is not an npm dependent of this package.

**If you maintain a custom MCP client, read the first entry before upgrading.**
Nothing else here needs action.

### Changed

- **Where tool metadata lives.** Tools that return a text result (`read`,
  `list`, `diff`, `patch`, `edit`, `delete`, `move`, `replace_text`,
  `search_text`, `find_files`) now ship their metadata under `_meta` instead of
  `structuredContent`. Clients that treat `structuredContent` as the canonical
  model view — Claude Code among them — discard the text blocks whenever it is
  present, so the model never saw the file `read` returned or the tree from
  `list`. It is the same object under a different field: a client doing
  `result.structuredContent.results` reads `result._meta.results` instead.
  Only `stat`, `create` and `list_roots` keep `structuredContent`.
- `read` appends a `// truncated:` line carrying the continuation args, and a
  `// sha256:` line when `includeHash` is set, after a blank line so neither can
  be read as file bytes. `list` appends a `nextCursor:` line, and a `truncated:`
  notice on hard-cap overflow.
- No tool publishes an `outputSchema` any more. Publishing one obliges the
  result to carry `structuredContent`, which every publisher has stopped doing.
- `stat`, `create` and `list_roots` no longer return a one-line text summary.
  Their value is the metadata, so they return JSON text and keep
  `structuredContent`.

### Fixed

- `list_roots` returns a `hint` naming the three ways to configure a root when
  it has none to list. An unconfigured server used to answer `{"roots":[]}` and
  leave the caller to guess; the elicitation route out — call a tool with a
  concrete path and approve the grant — appeared in no tool description.
  Present only when `roots` is empty.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-08-27

This is a breaking release. Every tool name and every environment variable
changed, and neither has a compatibility fallback. Read the two migration
tables below before upgrading.

### Breaking — tool names

The tool surface was consolidated from 17 tools to 13. Batch behaviour moved
into the single-item tools rather than living in separate `*_many` tools, and
the remaining names were made consistent.

| 1.x tool             | 2.0 equivalent                  |
| :------------------- | :------------------------------ |
| `ls`                 | `list`                          |
| `grep`               | `search_text`                   |
| `find`               | `find_files`                    |
| `mv`                 | `move`                          |
| `rm`                 | `delete`                        |
| `roots`              | `list_roots`                    |
| `apply_patch`        | `patch`                         |
| `diff_files`         | `diff`                          |
| `search_and_replace` | `replace_text`                  |
| `write`              | `create`                        |
| `tree`               | `list` with `maxDepth`          |
| `stat_many`          | `stat` with `paths[]`           |
| `calculate_hash`     | `read` with `includeHash: true` |
| `mkdir`              | removed — see below             |

`edit`, `read`, and `stat` keep their names. Both `read` and `stat` accept
either a single `path` or a `paths[]` batch.

**`mkdir` has no direct replacement.** `create` writes files and creates any
missing parent directories along the way, so a directory can be produced as a
side effect of writing a file inside it. Creating an empty directory on its own
is no longer possible through a tool call.

### Breaking — environment variables

Every environment variable is now prefixed `FS_`, with no fallback to the old
name. A configuration file carrying 1.x names will be read as entirely unset,
which for `FS_API_KEY` means an HTTP server starts unauthenticated. Audit
deployment configuration before upgrading.

| 1.19.1 variable                 | 2.0 variable             |
| :------------------------------ | :----------------------- |
| `FILESYSTEM_MCP_API_KEY`        | `FS_API_KEY`             |
| `FILESYSTEM_MCP_HTTP_HOST`      | `FS_HTTP_HOST`           |
| `FILESYSTEM_MCP_LOG_LEVEL`      | `FS_LOG_LEVEL`           |
| `FS_CONTEXT_ALLOW_SENSITIVE`    | `FS_ALLOW_SENSITIVE`     |
| `FS_CONTEXT_DENYLIST`           | `FS_DENYLIST`            |
| `FS_CONTEXT_MAX_REQUEST_BYTES`  | `FS_MAX_REQUEST_BYTES`   |
| `FS_CONTEXT_MAX_INLINE_MATCHES` | `FS_MAX_INLINE_MATCHES`  |
| `MAX_FILE_SIZE`                 | `FS_MAX_FILE_SIZE`       |
| `MAX_READ_MANY_TOTAL_SIZE`      | `FS_MAX_READ_MANY_BYTES` |
| `DEFAULT_SEARCH_TIMEOUT`        | `FS_SEARCH_TIMEOUT_MS`   |

`FS_ALLOWED_DIRS` and `NO_COLOR` keep their names.

These 1.19.1 variables are no longer read and have no replacement:
`FS_CONTEXT_ALLOWLIST`, `FS_CONTEXT_MAX_INLINE_CHARS`,
`FS_CONTEXT_STRIP_STRUCTURED`, `FS_CONTEXT_SEARCH_WORKERS`,
`FS_CONTEXT_SEARCH_WORKERS_DEBUG`, `FS_CONTEXT_LIST_CURSOR_TTL_MS`,
`FS_CONTEXT_DIAGNOSTICS`, `FS_CONTEXT_DIAGNOSTICS_DETAIL`,
`FS_CONTEXT_TOOL_LOG_ERRORS`, `MAX_SEARCH_SIZE`,
`FILESYSTEM_MCP_MAX_HTTP_SESSIONS`, `FILESYSTEM_MCP_MAX_TASK_TTL_MS`, and
`FILESYSTEM_MCP_MAX_CONCURRENT_TASKS`.

2.0 adds `FS_ROOT_BOUNDARY`, `FS_ALLOW_CWD_WALK`, `FS_ALLOW_MISSING_ROOTS`,
`FS_TRUST_PROXY`, `FS_ALLOWED_HOSTS`, `FS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`,
`FS_ALLOW_UNRESTRICTED_HOSTS`, `FS_PUBLIC_URL`, `FS_RATE_LIMIT_RPM`,
`FS_MAX_WATCHERS`, and `FS_REQUEST_STATE_KEY`. The README documents every
variable with its default and accepted range.

Boolean parsing also changed. `true` and `1` enable a variable; `false`, `0`,
and empty disable it. Any other value now logs a warning once and reads as
disabled, where 1.x accepted it silently as false.
`FS_ALLOW_UNRESTRICTED_HOSTS` goes through the same grammar as every other
boolean rather than its own.

### Breaking — package exports

The package root export was removed. `dist/index.js` is the CLI entry point: it
parses `process.argv` and starts a server on import, and its declaration file
was empty, so importing the package root never gave callers an API. The
`filesystem-mcp` binary and the `./transport` subpath export are unaffected.

### Added

- `FS_PORT` mirrors `--port`, so the HTTP transport can be enabled entirely
  from the environment. An empty string reads as unset.
- `FS_KEEPALIVE_TIMEOUT_MS` replaces the hard-coded 5-second HTTP keep-alive.
  `headersTimeout` is derived from it as the configured value plus 5 seconds.
  Set this above the idle timeout of any proxy in front of the server.
- The published `server.json` now declares `--read-only`, the `FS_ALLOWED_DIRS`
  environment variable, and the Docker runtime arguments (`-i`, `--rm`, and the
  volume mount), so registry clients generate a working install command for
  both the npm and container packages.

### Fixed

- **`--api-key` and `--http-host` had no effect.** Both were parsed and
  documented but never reached the HTTP server, so `--api-key <secret>` started
  an unauthenticated server. `--log-level`, `--max-file-size`,
  `--root-boundary`, `--allow-sensitive`, and `--deny` were dropped the same
  way. All seven now take precedence over their environment variable, as
  `--help` has always claimed.
- **`FS_LOG_LEVEL` / `--log-level` now filters output.** The value was parsed
  and ignored; every message reached stderr regardless. Messages below the
  configured severity are now suppressed — with the default of `info`, `debug`
  output no longer appears unless requested.
- A loopback HTTP bind rejected `Host: localhost` and `Host: [::1]` with
  `403 Invalid Host`, so `http://localhost:<port>/mcp` failed on a default
  server. All three loopback spellings are accepted.
- Host allow-list values consisting only of separators or whitespace read as an
  empty allow-list that rejected every request; they now read as unset.
- A `500` on the HTTP POST route replied with `id: null` even when the request
  carried an id, leaving clients waiting for a correlatable response.
- **`delete` reported a narrower error shape than every other tool.** Its
  `failures[].error` published only `code` and `message`, dropping the `path`
  and `suggestion` the handler had already computed. It now emits
  `PerFileError`, matching `create`, `move`, and `replace`.

### Changed

- Updated core dependencies.
- Refined internal schemas and agent configurations.
- `--api-key` is documented as development-only; `FS_API_KEY` is the supported
  channel, since argv is world-readable.

### Removed

- **Removed the experimental tasks subsystem.** The task store, task-augmented
  tool execution, and the `FILESYSTEM_MCP_MAX_TASK_TTL_MS` /
  `FILESYSTEM_MCP_MAX_CONCURRENT_TASKS` settings are gone. SEP-2663 removed
  tasks from the SDK; long operations report through progress notifications
  instead.
- **Removed the `logging` capability and the `logging/setLevel` handler.**
  Clients calling `logging/setLevel` now receive `METHOD_NOT_FOUND`. The
  handler only set a field nothing read, and SEP-2577 deprecates the subsystem;
  diagnostics go to stderr, controlled by `FS_LOG_LEVEL`.
- Removed dead diagnostics, tracing, and performance tests from `observability.test.ts`.
- Removed dead W3C trace surface and unreachable diagnostics config from `observability.ts`.
- Removed dead `startPerfMeasure`/`withOpsTrace` and `withToolDiagnostics` subsystems.
- Removed dead `RESOURCE_STORE_DIAGNOSTICS_CHANNEL` and `LIFECYCLE_CHANNEL` publishers.
